Here you will find all the PCB files for Version 1.0, sorted by PCB revisions.  
If there is a folder that does not contain all the necessary PCB files, the PCB has not been updated in the revision. 
In that case, the board from the previous revision is being used. 
You will find a comment about the revised boards in every subfolder. 
This also lists the compatible revisions of previous boards, for those PCB's that remain unchanged. 
You should also find a revision number on the PCB of your Controller.  
Note that the first ever production run starts as revision 2.0, as the revisions 1.0 to 1.3 were prototype versions.
