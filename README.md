# The-Red-Lion-Pro-Controller

This Repository contains all the files belonging to the Red Lion Pro Controller. 
The Red Lion Pro is an open source hardware project. I believe in the spirit of the OSHW movement and that it helps us all make our products better, more efficiently and more affordably. 

If you don't know what Open Source Hardware means, check out these videos, that explains it fairly well.

If you can't be bothered, here are the Basics in a Nutshell:
1) The Designer (me) releases all his design files to the open public, on an forum like this.
2) The Users (you) are granted access to the files, so they can repair it, modify it and improve it. 
3) You are free to release your modified version of my product. 
4) If you base your design on another person's work, it is good courtesy to give them a shoutout in your documentation/code. 
5) Products based on an OSHW design should also be OSHW products. Releasing it under commercial license is not ok. 
6) A design based on another is fair game, however a complete copy is, while not illegal, highly frowned upon. 
Which sums up the basic spirit of the Open Source Hardware Community: Be nice to the others, and they will be nice to you.
