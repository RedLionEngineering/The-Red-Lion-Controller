### Version 1.0

Here you will find all the Schematic files for Version 1.0, sorted by Schematic revisions.  
If there is a folder that does not contain all the necessary Schematic files, the Schematic has not been updated in the revision. 
In that case, the board from the previous revision is being used. 
You will find a comment about the revised boards in every subfolder. 
This also lists the compatible revisions of previous boards, for those Schematics that remain unchanged. 
You should also find a revision number on the PCB of your Controller.  
Note that the first ever production run starts as revision 2.0, as the revisions 1.0 to 1.3 were prototype versions.  
Note also that due to a minor design modification, the LogicBoard and Handle start out from revision 2.1.
