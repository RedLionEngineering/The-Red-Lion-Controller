## Code Files

This folder contains the Code files for the Red Lion Pro Controller. All files have been exported with Arduino IDE 1.8.3 or later.  
To program the ATtiny167, you also need the [ATtinyCore](https://github.com/SpenceKonde/ATTinyCore).  
To reflash your microcontroller, you will need an Atmel type ISP programmer of some description.  
Open the file in your Arduino IDE, set up your programmer and connect your logic board. **Watch the pinout.**  
Select "Upload using programmer". If you still experience problems, try to reset the fuses. Read how in the instructions of Spence Konde's Core. The fuse settings are described in the comment before the code. **Make sure you get the correct code version for your board.**
